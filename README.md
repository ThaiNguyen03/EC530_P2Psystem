# EC530_P2Psystem

# Description

This is a project to implement a simple chat system that utilizes P2P connection. To use, first run server.py, then run 2 instances of client.py. The 2 instances of client.py should be able to send messages through server.py to each other in P2P fashion.
This P2P system also includes synchronization. New users should be able to receive messages sent by previous users upon joining.
